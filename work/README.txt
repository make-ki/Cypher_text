This is an unfinished upload originally meant for a encryption game that utilizes encrytion techniques used during WW2. 
The game was co-developed with a biophysics major who dropped the project in between to continue his research on non-invasive techniques to measure
heat transfers in heterogenous systems (in language I speak, its some fancy temperature sensor for brain, used for hyperthermia treatments and other monitoring).
